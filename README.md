# Ulbumy
`Ulbumy` is a beginner project in react js to practice and learn about async thunks and backend data fetching methods with reduxjs store.

## Design
The app would initially have a list of users and a new user can be created by clicking the `add user` button. When clicked on a user's card, it expands and lists some albums associated with that particular user. A new album can be created by clicking on the `add album` button inside user's card. When clicked on a album, it expands and renders some images associated with that particular album. A new image can be added in that album by clicking on the `add image` button.
